  - `shoes`
  - `sweaters`

# phases

## phase 0 -- planning

ongoing year-round
tactical plan generated by NB3 and team, then vetted / stamped by Board of Directors

### phase 1 -- information distribution

ongoing year-round with periodic emphasis
holiday season 2019/20 saw 6 '[tabling](https://urbanangelssf.github.io/lavamae-mar17-2020/02_tabling.html)' events where uaSF volunteers manned an information-distribution booth in the plaza below the office -- immediately between Safeway and Walgreen's for great traffic.


### phase 2 -- clothing collection

ongoing year-round
  - Mon-Fri 9am-3pm:  drop-off at UrbanAngelsSF.org office (5228 Diamond Heights Blvd)
  - after hours, bin for drop-off at the same location (outside, to the left of the front door)
  - pickup can be arranged for 3+ bags of clothing

### phase 3 -- [sortANDfold event(s)](https://urbanangelssf.github.io/lavamae-mar17-2020/03_sortANDfold.html)

10:30am Saturday March 14 at the UrbanAngelsSF.org office (5228 Diamond Heights Blvd)

followed immediately thereafter by a volunteers potluck event at Christopher Playground next door.

### phase 4 -- transfer

for lavamae events uaSF volunteers will attend directly, sorted/folded bags are moved to storage unit after the sortANDfold,
then to the lavamae site itself on the morning of the event via rental truck.

alternatively, for the distant events (e.g. oakland) which uaSF does NOT directly attend, lavamae volunteers pick up the sorted / folded bags at the uaSF office.

### phase 5 -- distribution

10-20 tables manned by uaSF and lavamae volunteers are onsite at lavamae popup care villages. 

### phase 6 -- redux

leftovers back to storage, rental truck returned
